    <h3>Academic Experience/ Projects</h3>
    <h4>Database Design</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Database design using <b>MYSQL</b> to implement entities, relationships,
        attributes.
      </li>
      <li><b>GetFit America</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A database was designed for fitness centers that stores employees,
          department and customer information
        </li>
        <li>
          Implemented (Create Read Update Delete) <b>CRUD</b> in the database
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>Software Development</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Word Guessing Software</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An application implemented in <b>Java</b>. The program was designed
          with a server that can host multiple clients who want to play the
          game.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>Mobile Application</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First Aid Training Simulator Application designed to teach and verify
        users.
      </li>
      <li>
        Used Scrum methodology, <b>Jira</b>, <b>Android Studio IDE</b> and
        <b>Java</b> during the development of the project.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Project that analyzed the relationship between two data sets. Carbon
        Dioxide Emissions and Chicago Gasoline Prices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Used <b>multivariate regression</b> to predict what the carbon dioxide
        emissions will be in the future using the gas prices from previous
        years.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Embedded Programming</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><b>LED Screen Scrolling Message Display</b></li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed a program that can display a two lone string custom message
          on an LCD display. The string characters are swapped from left to
          right to provide a horizontal scrolling effect on the screen.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <b>Light Intensity and Potentiometer Rotation Detection Programming</b>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Developed a program that plots two-line graphs for two analog inputs
          received from the Arduino. The analog inputs come from the
          potentiometer and a light sensor. The program is designed to sense the
          different light intensity variation that the light sensor is
          detecting. As the sensor reads the different intensities, the readings
          are displayed on a separate program that shows a graph line that
          either inclines or declines depending on the light reading. The
          potentiometer is a mechanical knob that can twist either clockwise or
          counterclockwise. Turning the knob in either direction will display a
          line graph on the same computer screen that indicates the direction of
          the knobâ€™s rotation.
